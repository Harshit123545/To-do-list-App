I created a To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a simple task manager, allowing users to add, view, and remove tasks. It demonstrates the use of basic web technologies to build a functional and interactive application.
<br>
Features
<br>
Add Tasks: Users can input a new task in the text field and add it to the list by clicking the "Add Task" button.
<br>
Remove Tasks: Each task in the list comes with a "Remove" button, enabling users to delete tasks they have completed or no longer need.
<br>
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
<br>
Technologies Used:
<br>
HTML: Provides the structure of the application, including the form for task input and the list for displaying tasks.
<br>
CSS: Used for styling the application, making it visually appealing with a clean and modern interface.
<br>
JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the application, enabling users to add and remove tasks dynamically.
